    "LLMs generate responses by predicting likely next tokens, enabling reasoning through patterns learned from data. Key reasoning approaches include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero-shot:** Answering tasks without examples.  \n",
    "- **Few-shot:** Learning from a few examples in the prompt.  \n",
    "- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Breaking problems into intermediate reasoning steps.  \n",
    "- **Analogical Reasoning:** Solving new problems using similarities to known cases.  \n",
    "- **Decoding Strategies:** Techniques like greedy, beam search, or sampling to generate outputs.  \n",
    "- **Self-Consistency:** Sampling multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer.  \n",

    "**Limitations:**  \n",
    "- **Irrelevant Context:** May include unrelated or distracting information from long prompts.  \n",
